Thing Finder is a litle tool to search for stuff in text file.  You can point it at a single file or a directory and it will recursively go through it to find the text(s) you want.

Take a look at test1.pl to see how it works.

You basically point it to a definition file and this tells it what to look for and where.

Definition file:
search_type=text-file
search_location=/tmp/find/
search_location=/home          <--Can have more than one search location
search_term=WARNING: Received \d+ programs from source for lineup   <--Regex
search_term=eight     <--Can have more than one search term
line_returned=3       <--How many lines to return surrounding the search_term
